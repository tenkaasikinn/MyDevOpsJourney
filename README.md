# My DevOps Journey  
_From Animal Science to DevOps Engineer_

[🇮🇩 Indonesian Version](./README_ID.md)

This repository documents my journey from an Animal Science graduate into the world of DevOps.  
I’m building my skills from the ground up — Linux, scripting, automation, containerization, CI/CD, and Infrastructure as Code — with a clear 11-week roadmap.

My goal is simple: **be job-ready as a DevOps Engineer within 3 months.**

## ⚙️ Tools & Environment

- **Laptop:** Toshiba Satellite A665-S5170  
- **OS:** Fedora Workstation 43  
- **Terminal:** Alacritty  
- **Editor:** Neovim & VSCodium

Fedora is my primary environment due to stability and modern tooling, and I keep everything CLI focused.

## 🎯 Why This Journey?
Switching fields is not a small step, but it is intentional.  
I started with no tech background, only determination, structure, and daily practice.

This repo becomes:
- My notebook  
- My progress tracker  
- My proof of consistency  
- My portfolio foundation
